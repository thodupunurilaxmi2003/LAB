                     <h1>Minor PROJECT LAB</h1>
                     <p>A mini project is an assignment that you try to complete at the end of every semester ,especially in engineering to strengthen the understanding of your fundamentals through effective application of theoretical concepts.There are separate credits for each mini project you complete at Academy, although few students taking up a project out of their own interest and passion.Mini project can help students to boost skills and widen students horizon of thinking.</p>

             <h1>COMPUTER NETWORKS LAB</h1>
             <P>This course provides students with hands on training regarding the design, troubleshooting,
modeling and evaluation of computer networks. In this course, students are going to
experiment in a real test-bed networking environment, and learn about network design and
troubleshooting topics and tools such as: network addressing, Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP), basic troubleshooting tools (e.g. ping, ICMP), IP routing (e,g, RIP), route discovery
(e.g. traceroute), TCP and UDP, IP fragmentation and many others. </P>

             <h1>BASIC MACHINE LEARNING LAB</h1>
             <P>The ML Lab is a centralized hub for data science teams to seamlessly build, deploy, and operate machine learning solutions at scale. It is designed to cover the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle from data processing and experimentation to model training and deployment.Machine learning is a lot like it sounds: the idea that various forms of technology, including tablets and computers, can learn something based on programming and other data. It looks like a futuristic concept, but this level of technology is used by most people every day. Speech recognition is an excellent example of this. Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa use the technology to recite reminders, answer questions, and follow commands </P>
